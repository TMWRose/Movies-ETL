# Movies-ETL

In this module, the company Amazing Prime wants to write an algorithm to predict the most popular low budget movies so they can buy the streaming rights to them. They decided to host a hack-a-thon where people can use provided clean data sets to predict what the most popular movies were going tobe that year. We helped Britta, a member of the Amazing Prime video team, create and clean these data sets.
